        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            We started Freelance Brand Scaling after seeing the same problem again and again:
            talented freelancers with strong skills but weak brands. Their work was good,
            but their online presence did not show their value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to help you build a simple, clear brand that works even when you are not online.
            No fake hype, no confusing funnels. Just honest strategy, clear offers, and small systems
            that you can actually maintain.
        </p>

        <p>
            We mainly work with freelance designers, developers, writers, and marketers
            who are ready to treat freelancing like a real business, not just a side hustle.
