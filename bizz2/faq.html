        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
        <p>
            Freelancers like designers, developers, writers, and marketers
            who want a clearer brand and better clients.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to be full–time?</h3>
        <p>
            No. You can be part–time or full–time. The key is that you are serious 
            about improving your freelance business.
        </p>

        <h3>How long until I see results?</h3>
        <p>
            It depends on your starting point, but many freelancers notice clearer
            branding and better client conversations within 4–8 weeks.
        </p>

        <h3>What if I do not have a niche yet?</h3>
        <p>
            That is normal. Part of this work is testing and choosing a direction
            based on your skills, interests, and the market.
        </p>

        <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>
            Pricing can change over time. The best way to get current details is to
            book a free strategy call on the Home page.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
        <p>
