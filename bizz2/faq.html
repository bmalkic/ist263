        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <h3>What platforms do you work with?</h3>
        <p>
            We mainly work with Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Google Ads, and TikTok.
            If you use something else, we can talk about it on the strategy call.
        </p>

        <h3>How much ad budget do I need?</h3>
        <p>
            It depends on your industry, but many small businesses start with a test budget
            and then scale up once we see what works.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you lock me into a long contract?</h3>
        <p>
            No long-term lock-ins. We believe people stay because the work helps,
            not because they are stuck in a contract.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you fix my existing ad account?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. We can review your current campaigns, find clear problems,
            and either fix them or give you a list of changes to make.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you also redesign websites?</h3>
        <p>
            We focus on ads first, but we can give simple feedback on landing pages
            and basic changes that may help conversion.
        </p>

        <h3>How do we get started?</h3>
        <p>
            Go to the <a href="index.html#apply">Home page</a> and fill out the short form.
            We will follow up with a free ad strategy call.
